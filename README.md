"Saghir's Notebook" in bookdown 

## Book For One Person - Me

**Objective:** To quickly access notes, personal information, coding tips, reference links, birthdays, addresses, telephone numbers, *etc.* in one place. 

**Why?** I wanted to have access on my computers and smart phone hosted **locally** (especially given the sensitive information). Setting up and maintaining a wiki was to much hassle.

**How?** Using the HTML version of R `bookdown` book which can be copied (synced) across devices. 

**Pros:** 

* All my key information is one place :):):)
* Immediately available on my browser (default homepage).
* No more random files with notes, bits of paper, post-it notes, ...
* Copy and paste friendly.
* As the only reader I can organise and re-organise it as I please.
* Easy to maintain and update. 
* HTML version of book works great on all devices.
* The built in `bookdown` search does the job of quickly finding information.
* No server needed.

**Cons:** 

* Have to sync after each update.
* First version took time to create.
