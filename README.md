## Book For One Person - Me

**Objective:** To quickly access notes, personal information, coding tips, reference links, birthdays, addresses, telephone numbers, *etc.* in one place. 

**How?** Using the HTML version of R `bookdown` book (which has been less work than setting up and maintaining a wiki).


**Why?** I wanted to have access on my computers and smart phone hosted **locally**. I copy (sync) the HTML version.

**Pros:** 

* All my key information is one place :):):) 
* As the only reader I organise and re-organise it as I please.
* Easy to maintain and update. 
* HTML version of book works great on all devices.
* The built in `bookdown` search helps me find what I need.
* No server needed.

**Cons:** 

* Have to sync after each update.
* First version took time to create.
