# My-Notebook-Template

*Saghir's Notebook 'Wiki':* an alternative use of `bookdown` as a "wiki".

> **Important note:** I should have called this "My-Example-Notebook-Wiki" or something 
similar. It is not a template in the traditional sense and was only intended to mean 
"my example structure and content" (i.e. showcase). I will leave the repository name 
as it is to prevent having broken links elsewhere.

## Book For One Person - Me

**Objective:** To quickly access notes, personal information, coding tips, reference links, birthdays, addresses, telephone numbers, *etc.* in one place.

**Why?** 

* To have key personal information and notes at my finger tips.
* All in one place.
* Hosted **locally** (due to sensitive info) on my computers and smart phone.
* Easy to maintain and update.

**How?** 

Using the HTML version of R `bookdown` book as a personal wiki which can be copied (synced) across devices. Default bookdown HTML stlye is more than good enough.

**Pros:** 

* All my key information is one place :):):)
* Immediately available on my browser (default homepage).
* No more random files with notes, bits of paper, post-it notes, bookmarks, *etc.*
* Copy and paste friendly.
* As the only reader I can organise and re-organise it as I please.
* Easy to maintain and update. 
* HTML version of book works great on all devices.
* The built in `bookdown` search does the job of finding information quickly.
* No server needed.

**Cons:** 

* Have to sync after each update.
* First version took time to create.
